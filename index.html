            <h3>Dr Martin Luther King</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 - April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and
                    activist who became the most visible spokesman and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955
                    until his assassination in 1968. An African American church leader and the son of early civil rights
                    activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the
                    United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the
                    nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws
                    and other forms of discrimination.</li>

                <li>King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other
                    civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of
                    the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the
                    unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963
                    protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where
                    he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights
                    movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of
                    1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.</li>
